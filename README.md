## Important Notes:
   1. Run the command (flutter pub get) in the project path before running the app.
   2. You can navigate between app's pages through the buttons.
   3. It is preferred to use a device with height of 866 and width of 411 or near to for better experience (Pixel 6 pro is recommended).
